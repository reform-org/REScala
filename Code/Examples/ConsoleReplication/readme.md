# Console Replication

In this case study, multiple peers can modify a replicated add-wins-set. It was developed to test the behavior of our Delta CRDT implementation in unreliable networks simulated by the [CORE Emulator](http://coreemu.github.io/core/). Also, it features two variants of a checkpoint mechanism for reducing the overhead of comparing the local state of two replicas when a connection between them is established.

## Checkpointing

In general, the idea of checkpointing is that when a connection is established between two replicas, they only have to exchange their checkpoint information instead of their full state. Based on these checkpoints, the replicas can find out what parts of the state they have in common and only exchange the parts of the state that a replica is still missing.

### Central Checkpointing

In this implementation, a central node holds the authority over recording checkpoints. Since this node builds a linear history of checkpoints, the checkpoint that a replica is currently on can simply be represented by a single counter value. The minimum size of changes for creating a new checkpoint can be set by adjusting the minCheckpointSize field in src/main/scala/central/Checkpointer.

### Decentral Checkpoint

In this variant, each replica can create and publish checkpoints for its own changes. The checkpoint information of each replica is then encoded as a vector clock where each entry represents the checkpoint counter of a different replica. The minimum and maximum size of changes for creating a new checkpoint can be set by adjusting the minAtomsForCheckpoint and maxAtomsForCheckpoint fields in src/main/scala/decentral/Replica.

## CORE Emulator Setup

First, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/dtn7/dtn7-rs/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md) to install CORE and create a simulated network.

Compile the case study using the sbt stage command in the ConsoleReplication project and copy the output folder Code/Examples/ConsoleReplication/target/universal/stage into /tmp/shared.

In the docker instance, install java and iptables:

```bash
apt update
apt install openjdk-8-jre
apt install iptables
```

Start the simulation in the CORE GUI and open a console for each connected host by double-clicking it in the GUI. Then, in each host console, execute the following commands (substituting 10.0.0.10 for the ip address assigned to the respective host in the simulation):

```bash
sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth0.route_localnet=1
iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING -p tcp -d 10.0.0.10/24 --dport 4444 -j DNAT --to-destination 127.0.0.1:4444
```

To simulate an unreliable network, double-clicking the wlan in the CORE GUI lets you configure some properties such as delay or loss%. To simulate replicas temporarily disconnecting and reconnecting, drag their hosts around in the GUI, they will lose the connection if they are dragged too far from other hosts.

## Starting Replicas

### Central

Start a checkpointer by executing in a host console:

```bash
/tmp/shared/stage/bin/central_console-replication checkpointer <listenport>
```

e.g.

```bash
/tmp/shared/stage/bin/central_console-replication checkpointer 4444
```

Start a replica by executing in a host console:

```bash
/tmp/shared/stage/bin/central_console-replication peer <id> <listenport> <connectTo>
```

e.g.

```bash
/tmp/shared/stage/bin/central_console-replication peer a 4444 10.0.0.11:4444 10.0.0.12:4444
```

### Decentral

Start a replica by executing in a host console:

```bash
/tmp/shared/stage/bin/decentral_console-replication replica <id> <listenport> <connectTo> <initSize>
```

e.g.

```bash
/tmp/shared/stage/bin/decentral_console-replication replica a 4444 10.0.0.10:4444 1000
```

initSize is used to initialize the set to contain the elements 0 until initSize

## Interacting with the CRDT

On each replica, the following commands can be used to interact with the add-wins-set:

* add n: add the number n to the set
* remove n: remove the number n from the set
* clear: remove all elements from the set
* elements: print all elements in the set
* size: print the size of the set
* exit: terminate the replica
